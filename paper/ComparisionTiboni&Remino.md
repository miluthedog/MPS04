- Monica Tiboni & Carlo Remino
- Note: Comparision of features

### Abstract
- Compares results obtained with different sensors and features as input
- Features: PSD and statistical indices (time-domain)
- Possible to condition monitoring, increase uptake of maintanance approach
- This paper use PSD, FFT and statistics and aim for the statistics set that robust enough

### Introduction - Related Works
- Goal: not only increase availability but also reduce planned maintainance and extend life
- ANN can model highly nonlinear systems. Machine considered black box

- Several authors suggested: closest neighbor interpolation, SMOTE, GANs, random oversampling and others. FEM, WPT, SVM,... </br>

### Methodology
- Method:
    - Data collections: test setup or running machine
    - Features: Time/Frequency/Time-Frequency
    - Net training
    - Health state recognition (and retraining based on real data)
- Setup sensor: Rod - Body - Z - All
- Setup faults: Loosened screw and air leak

- Compare: PSD and FFT most commonly used, research choose PSD (image: Rod Body)
- Compare: RMS, skewness and kurtosis considered (image: Rod Body Z All)
- Peak and crest depend on sampling frequency which may not true if frequency is low
- Compare: Max PSD Frequency - Neurons (image: Rod Body)
- Compare: Features - Neurons (image: Rod Body Z All)

### Results, Conclusion
- "body" higher accuracy, but "rod" sensors with high PSD and sufficient neurons can achieve perfect classification
- Statistical features "body" monoaxial sensor high accurate and reliable fault detection, "rod" and Arduino are less effective
- Evaluating using weighted error rather than raw accuracy
- Monoaxial "body" using Z-axis signals with 150 Hz PSD and 80% data outperform Arduino sensors in classification errors
- Statistical features "body" make less critical errors, even with less training data
